# Pong Game (Python Turtle)

A recreation of the classic **Pong** game built with Python's built-in `turtle` graphics library.  
Two players can control paddles and compete to keep the ball in play. Points are awarded when the opponent misses the ball.

## Features
- Classic Pong mechanics
- Two-player controls:
  - **Right Paddle:** Arrow keys (`Up`, `Down`)
  - **Left Paddle:** `W` (up), `S` (down)
- Scoreboard that tracks points
- Ball bounces off walls and paddles
- Game ends when the user closes the window

## Requirements
- Python 3.8+  
- No external libraries required (uses built-in `turtle` and `time` modules).

## Installation

1. Clone or copy this repository.
2. Ensure you have Python installed (3.8 or higher recommended).
3. No additional packages are required since the game uses Pythonâ€™s standard library.

## Usage

Run the main game file:

```bash
python main.py
```
